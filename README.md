# Functional Programming in Kotlin
This repository contains the exercises that I'm currently working through while reading the `Functional Programming in Kotlin` Book (https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-kotlin)

## Decisions:
- Instead of creating a specific library for each exercise implementation. I've decided to keep it simple by adding the implementation method as part of the test itself, and then testing the newly created method within the same context. 

## Instructions to run:
- `./gradlew build` using the command line
- Alternatively, use IntelliJ to run the tests. 

## Testing
- Using KoTest framework (https://github.com/kotest/kotest) to test the implementation of the exercises
- Each exercise has its own implementation + test that can be run to verify the implementation code.
